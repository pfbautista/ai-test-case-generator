## ðŸ§  Portfolio Case Study

### Project Summary
AI-Powered QA Assistant is a Flask web application that integrates OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 to generate detailed QA test cases from feature descriptions. Built to demonstrate how LLMs can assist software testers in reducing manual effort and improving test coverage.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Python (Flask)
- REST API design
- OpenAI API integration
- LLM prompt engineering
- Test automation design
- Frontend (HTML/JS)
- CI-ready with `pytest`
- Deployed to Heroku

### Resume Bullet (STAR Format)
- **Situation**: QA Engineers often spend hours writing test cases manually.
- **Task**: Build a faster, smarter solution using modern tools.
- **Action**: Designed and built a Flask app that uses GPT-4 to generate test cases from natural language.
- **Result**: Streamlined test planning workflow, and published project to GitHub + Heroku.

### LinkedIn Post Template
ðŸš€ Just launched my personal project: **AI-Powered QA Assistant**!  
This Flask app uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to turn feature descriptions into test casesâ€”instantly.  
Great for QA Engineers looking to level up with AI.
